I've had my VTR250 for 3 months now, and I've finally decided to fix an issue that's been really bugging me:
the rear brake lever.

The rear brake lever on the VTR250 is clearly not intended for somebody with stiff ankles and a size 15 shoe,
as it's a huge strech to cover the brake. Luckily even though it's not documented in the manual it's an easy
fix. 

You will need: 
* M10 Spanner (Open)
* M12 Spanner (Open)

It's very simple unless you do it wrong, which as I was reading online, lots do...
Some things to note:
* Don't depress the brake lever after losening nut 3, you will spill brake fluid.
* Once you've finished make sure your brake operates correctly before going off for a ride...

In order:

1. Loosen nut 3, just enough to get back the torque point (1/4-1/2 a turn). 
2. Loosen nut 1, slide it up the shaft 1/2cm or so. 
3. Move the shaft by turning bolt 2 which is attached to it. Move the shaft down to lower the lever, 
up to raise it. 
4. Tighten nuts 3 and 1 back up again.  

Thanks it. Super easy. No idea why this isn't documented this easily somewhere, prehaps becasue it's so 
simple, but I was doing it wrong and would have appreciated a guide like this.
