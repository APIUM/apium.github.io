I've had my VTR250 for 3 months now, and I've finally decided to fix an issue that's been really bugging me:
the brake lever.

The brake lever on the VTR250 is clearly not intended for somebody with stiff ankles and a size 15 shoe,
as it's a huge strech to cover the brake. Luckily even though it's not documented in the manual it's an easy
fix. 

You will need: 
* M10 Spanner (Open)
* M12 Spanner (Open)

It's very simple unless you do it wrong, which as I was reading online, lots do...
In order:

1. Loosen nut 3, just enough to let it move freely. 
2. Loosen nut 1, slide it up the bolt 1/2cm or so. 
3. Move the shaft by turning bolt 2 which is attached to it. Move the shaft down to lower the lever,
 up to raise it. 

Thanks it. Super easy. No idea why this isn't documented this easily somewhere, prehaps becasue it's so 
simple, but I was doing it wrong and would have appreciated a guide like this.
