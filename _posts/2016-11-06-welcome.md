I generally don't write things on the internet, save a reddit comment once in a blue moon --- but it doesn't have to be this way.

I've created this site as a way to occasionally interact with a non-existant audience in a way that lets me clack away on the HHKB2. It will also allow me to post projects and guides, both for self-refrence and to maybe help the wider community. 

There likley won't be anything interesting on here, and this post sounds pretty ridiculous, but let's just assume that I'll be the only one who would actually read this, and it's nice to have a post here rather than it being blank. 

Algy.
